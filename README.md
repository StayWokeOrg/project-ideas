Project ideas

Edit this document to record ideas for projects you'd like to see created.

# Organization

## Build a website

For now, something basic on staywokeorg.github.io?

## Guidelines for project ownerships, starting new projects, etc.

@nhuntwalker has already done some thinking on this.

# Telephony

## Improve the Call Congress hotline to include state & local reps

Let's beyond just calling Congress.

## Specific hotlines for key issues

We're going to launch an issue-specific hotline for the nomination hearings this coming week (1/9/17).  We should generalize this.

# Other

## Station Checkers

At my last job I wrote a tablet app for station checkers, the people who go around to train stations and collect info on the conditions there -- how much graffiti is there, how many clocks there are vs. how many are working, etc. I feel like something similar might be useful for keeping tabs on police patrols for instance.
