Project ideas
---

Edit this document to record ideas for projects you'd like to see created.

## Organization

### Build a website

For now, something basic on staywokeorg.github.io?

### Guidelines for project ownerships, starting new projects, etc.

@nhuntwalker has already done some thinking on this.

## Telephony

### Improve the Call Congress hotline to include state & local reps

Let's beyond just calling Congress.

### Specific hotlines for key issues

We're going to launch an issue-specific hotline for the nomination hearings this coming week (1/9/17).  We should generalize this.

## Other

### Monthly Donation Drive

Every month chose an organization in harmony with our mission and do a fund drive. In the form of sending an email list that sends out an email with a link, and a website that shows a profile of the org.  Once or twice a year, use it to fund any of our own needs.

### Branded set of Meetups

Using Meetup, create a simple way for people to set up a monthly meetup and recruit folks in a particular city.  Have some guidelines for what they can work on or how the meetup would function.  Could be at times just a discussion group; could be seed of a protest group; many possibilities. 

### Database of Public Figures w/ ties to Policing & Prison industry

Easily browseable and easily/automatically updated database of all elected officials documenting any ties to these industries.  E.g. previous work experience, donations/funding, allies, etc.

### Station Checkers

At my last job I wrote a tablet app for station checkers, the people who go around to train stations and collect info on the conditions there -- how much graffiti is there, how many clocks there are vs. how many are working, etc. I feel like something similar might be useful for keeping tabs on police patrols for instance.

### Who's My Rep?

A Twitter bot, where you tweet your zip code at it and it tweets back your Congressional representatives along with their phone numbers.
