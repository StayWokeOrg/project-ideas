Project ideas
---

Edit this document to record ideas for projects you'd like to see created.

## Organization

### Build a website

For now, something basic on staywokeorg.github.io?

### Guidelines for project ownerships, starting new projects, etc.

@nhuntwalker has already done some thinking on this.

## Telephony

### Improve the Call Congress hotline to include state & local reps

Let's beyond just calling Congress.

### Specific hotlines for key issues

We're going to launch an issue-specific hotline for the nomination hearings this coming week (1/9/17).  We should generalize this.

## Other

### Monthly Donation Drive

Every month chose an organization in harmony with our mission and do a fund drive. In the form of sending an email list that sends out an email with a link, and a website that shows a profile of the org.  Once or twice a year, use it to fund any of our own needs.

### Branded set of Meetups

Using Meetup, create a simple way for people to set up a monthly meetup and recruit folks in a particular city.  Have some guidelines for what they can work on or how the meetup would function.  Could be at times just a discussion group; could be seed of a protest group; many possibilities.

### Database of Public Figures w/ ties to Policing & Prison industry

Easily browseable and easily/automatically updated database of all elected officials documenting any ties to these industries.  E.g. previous work experience, donations/funding, allies, etc.

### Station Checkers

At my last job I wrote a tablet app for station checkers, the people who go around to train stations and collect info on the conditions there -- how much graffiti is there, how many clocks there are vs. how many are working, etc. I feel like something similar might be useful for keeping tabs on police patrols for instance.

### Who's My Rep?

A Twitter bot, where you tweet your zip code at it and it tweets back your Congressional representatives along with their phone numbers.

### Local town hall with members of Congress database

There is no easy way that I know of to lookup when your reps are going to hold a local town hall; you have to be signed up for their email newsletter. If we could get people to submit dates when when find out a local town hall is happening we can then contact other people in that area. I know showing up to town halls was effective for the tea party.

### Browser Extension Delivering Daily Actions for Civil Disobedience and Action

While individuals are browsing news sites and social media platforms, the browser extension glows to indicate that actions can be done to combat your unhappiness with what you're reading. The 4-6 acts can be switched out periodically on the back-end, but will generally be calling representatives and other Stay Woke tools, all available in the browser. Empower individuals to make the change they wish to see. #lazyActivisimUpgraded
